columns from a DataFrame.\n","\n","To slice out a set of rows, you use this syntax: data\\[start:stop],\n","\n","here the start represents the index from where to consider, and stop represents the index one step BEYOND the row you want to select. You can perform slicing using both the index and the name of the column.\n","\n","> NOTE: When slicing in pandas, the start bound is included in the output.\n","\n","So if you want to select rows 0, 1, and 2 your code would look like this: df.iloc\\[0:3].\n","\n","It means you are telling Python to start at index 0 and select rows 0, 1, 2 up to but not including 3.\n","\n","> NOTE: Labels must be found in the DataFrame or you will get a KeyError.\n","\n","Indexing by labels(i.e. using <code>loc()</code>) differs from indexing by integers (i.e. using <code>iloc()</code>). With <code>loc()</code>, both the start bound and the stop bound are inclusive. When using <code>loc()</code>, integers can be used, but the integers refer to the index label and not the position.\n","\n","For example, using <code>loc()</code> and select 1:4 will get a different result than using <code>iloc()</code> to select rows 1:4.\n","\n","<h4 id=\"data\">We can also select a specific data value using a row and column location within the DataFrame and iloc indexing.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":112},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":426,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710098548157,"user":{"displayName":"Tomás Serna Giraldo","userId":"10446898718782054918"},"user_tz":300},"id":"Mwac9_0QvEsr","outputId":"e58d10e8-db57-4aa5-c41b-4a50e8c94805"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n  \"name\": \"df\",\n  \"rows\": 2,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"student\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"samuel\",\n          \"david\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 24,\n        \"max\": 27,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          24,\n          27\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"canada\",\n          \"uk\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-99c96c72-1085-43e4-8bf9-e315515d30aa\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>student</th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>country</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>david</td>\n","      <td>27</td>\n","      <td>uk</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>samuel</td>\n","      <td>24</td>\n","      <td>canada</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-99c96c72-1085-43e4-8bf9-e315515d30aa')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-99c96c72-1085-43e4-8bf9-e315515d30aa button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
